# SlasherSelfBot
to start use you must have node.js install from https://node.js.org/
once node installs run the node file then once node is installed run InstallModules.cmd then run selfbotrun.bat runselfbot.cmd will launch just the selfbot alone with no message logger (logs the messages of every server you are in to your command promt) if it says invalid token do this https://youtu.be/sZpdZ7ST7IU or if it says cannot find module discord.js-selfbot open cmd in the folder and do npm i discord.js-selfbot
